# photo-album-hyperdrive
A Beaker-powered photo album app

## Requirements

- Beaker 1.0

## Usage

This site relies on the user adding content to a local folder, which Beaker then syncs to a hyperdrive. 

- Create a hyperdrive with folder sync on, and copy these files inside.
- Inside the `photos` folder, add a folder for every album you want to create.
